Test Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology where tests precede actual coding, ensuring software meets its requirements from the start. Its strengths are evident in the code quality it delivers. By emphasizing testing upfront, TDD ensures that software is robust and modular. This proactive approach also identifies and rectifies defects early, streamlining the development process and averting the long-term costs associated with fixing bugs. Furthermore, TDD promotes thoughtful software design. When developers craft tests before writing the actual code, they're pushed to think more deeply about the system's structure and behavior, leading to better design choices. The tests themselves double as a form of dynamic documentation, making clear the intended functions and behaviors of software components. This is especially beneficial for onboarding new team members or revisiting older projects. Additionally, a solid test suite gives developers the confidence to refactor or enhance code, knowing that any regressions will be promptly flagged.

However, TDD does have a few downsides. The initial jump into TDD can be time-intensive, especially for those acclimating to its principles. While the methodology emphasizes unit testing, overreliance on this can overshadow the need for comprehensive integration and system tests. There's also the lurking danger of overengineering, where solutions become overly complex in a bid to meet test conditions. As projects mature, maintaining the test suite can demand significant effort, especially if the tests aren't well-crafted. And, TDD might not be the best fit for all scenarios, particularly projects with experimental requirements.
