Test Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology where tests precede actual coding, ensuring software meets its requirements from the onset. The advantages of TDD include improved code quality, early bug detection, and better software design. Additionally, these tests often serve as a form of documentation, allow for confident refactoring, and support continuous integration processes. On the downside, TDD can be initially time-consuming, introducing a learning curve for those unfamiliar. There's also the risk of overemphasizing unit tests and potentially overengineering solutions. As software evolves, maintaining the test suite might become burdensome. Moreover, TDD may not be apt for every project, especially those with rapidly changing requirements. In essence, while TDD has clear benefits in terms of code robustness and design, it requires careful implementation to avoid its potential pitfalls.
